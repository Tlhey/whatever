### data analysis
### Casual Inference

Intervention

ATE Average Treatment Effect
$T\rightarrow Y$
$ATE = \mathbb{E}[Y(t=1) - Y(t=0)] = \mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)]$
only one of Y(1) or Y(0) is observed (Random)

$T\perp Y(1), Y(0)$ T: treatment assignment
$ATE = \mathbb{E}[Y(1)] -\mathbb{E}[Y(0)]$
$= \mathbb{E}[Y(1) | T=1] - \mathbb{E}[Y(0) | T=0]$

Problem: randomized data samples, 

DO operator
DAG: Directed Acyclic Graph

Bayesian network
pr(X|nodes) = pr (X| parents of X)

Slides 34 啥意思啊 Reduce casual relationship as do op, to observe conditional probabilityies

### 
## 01-15
$P_m$ manipulated proability

average casual effect
casual effect difference:$P(Y=1|do(X=1))-P(Y=1|do(X=0))$

## 01-29
Equalized odds
prediction parity

1. Abduction
2.
3. 


### Fair
Discrimination as a casual term
