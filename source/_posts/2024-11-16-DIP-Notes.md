### Common Notations for Morphological Operations

Morphological operations have well-defined notations, often derived from set theory or mathematical morphology conventions. Here’s how to represent them using symbols:

---

#### **1. Erosion (腐蚀)**
- **Mathematical Notation**: \( A \ominus B \)
  - \( A \): Input image or set.
  - \( B \): Structuring element (SE).
- **Definition**:
  \[
  A \ominus B = \{ z \mid (B)_z \subseteq A \}
  \]
  Where \( (B)_z \) is the translation of \( B \) to point \( z \), and \( \subseteq \) indicates that \( B \) fits within \( A \).

---

#### **2. Dilation (膨胀)**
- **Mathematical Notation**: \( A \oplus B \)
  - \( A \): Input image or set.
  - \( B \): Structuring element (SE).
- **Definition**:
  \[
  A \oplus B = \{ z \mid (B)_z \cap A \neq \emptyset \}
  \]
  Where \( (B)_z \) is the translation of \( B \) to point \( z \), and \( \cap \) indicates intersection.

---

#### **3. Opening (开运算)**
- **Mathematical Notation**: \( A \circ B \)
  - \( A \): Input image or set.
  - \( B \): Structuring element (SE).
- **Definition**:
  \[
  A \circ B = (A \ominus B) \oplus B
  \]
  Opening is erosion followed by dilation.

---

#### **4. Closing (闭运算)**
- **Mathematical Notation**: \( A \bullet B \)
  - \( A \): Input image or set.
  - \( B \): Structuring element (SE).
- **Definition**:
  \[
  A \bullet B = (A \oplus B) \ominus B
  \]
  Closing is dilation followed by erosion.

---

#### **5. Hit-or-Miss Transformation (击中与未击中变换)**
- **Mathematical Notation**: \( A \otimes B \)
  - \( A \): Input binary image.
  - \( B \): Structuring element or pattern (composed of \( B_1 \) and \( B_2 \)).
- **Definition**:
  \[
  A \otimes B = (A \ominus B_1) \cap (A^c \ominus B_2)
  \]
  Where:
  - \( A^c \): Complement of \( A \).
  - \( B_1, B_2 \): Structuring elements for the object and background, respectively.

### How to Write These Symbols in LaTeX
You can easily represent these notations using LaTeX. Here are some examples:

- **Erosion**: `A \ominus B`
- **Dilation**: `A \oplus B`
- **Opening**: `A \circ B`
- **Closing**: `A \bullet B`
- **Hit-or-Miss**: `A \otimes B`

### A Distinguish Between Concepts

---

1. **Skeletonizing**: \( \mathcal{K} \) : \( \mathcal{K}(A) = \bigcup_{n=1}^N (A \ominus nB) - [(A \ominus nB) \circ B] \)  
   **Definition**: Reduces objects to their centerline representation (skeleton) by iterative erosion and removal of boundary pixels while preserving object connectivity.  
   **Purpose**: Captures the fundamental structure of objects for analysis, such as handwriting recognition or shape description.  
   **Structural Element (SE)**:  
   - Typically a circular or square SE is used for iterative erosion.  
   - Example SE:  
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & 1 & 0 \\
     1 & 1 & 1 \\
     0 & 1 & 0
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

---

2. **Thinning**: \( T \) : \( T(A) = \lim_{n \to N} (A \ominus nB) \)  
   **Definition**: Removes outer layers of pixels iteratively, leaving a minimally connected structure that represents the object's shape.  
   **Purpose**: Simplifies shapes while preserving their topology and connectivity. Useful for applications like fingerprint analysis and character recognition.  
   **Structural Element (SE)**:  
   - A directional SE is used to iteratively remove pixels layer by layer.  
   - Example SE:  
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & 0 & 0 \\
     1 & 1 & 1 \\
     0 & 0 & 0
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]  

---

3. **Shrinking**: \( S \) : \( S(A) = \{ z \in A \mid B \text{ fits within } A_z \} \)  
   **Definition**: Shrinks objects iteratively by removing pixels while ensuring the object does not disconnect or vanish entirely.  
   **Purpose**: Reduces objects until they are minimized to a single pixel or central skeleton point. Useful for connected component analysis.  
   **Structural Element (SE)**:  
   - A small SE (e.g., 3x3 or 5x5) designed to maintain object connectivity.  
   - Example SE:  
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 1 & 1 \\
     1 & 1 & 1 \\
     1 & 1 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

### Relationships and Summary

- **Skeletonizing**: Captures the "core" or "centerline" of an object. Involves iterative erosion while preserving connectivity.
- **Thinning**: A simpler reduction compared to skeletonizing, focusing on removing boundary layers iteratively.
- **Shrinking**: Minimizes objects while maintaining their connectivity, often leading to a single pixel or minimal structure.

Each operation uses structural elements (SEs) tailored to the object’s geometry and the specific processing goal. These concepts are built upon basic morphological operations like erosion and dilation.
